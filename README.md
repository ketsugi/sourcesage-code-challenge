# sourcesage-code-challenge

Written to meet the requirements as laid out at https://github.com/jianminsim/sourcesage-dev-test

Backend API class cribbed and extended from [Corey Maynard's tutorial](http://coreymaynard.com/blog/creating-a-restful-api-with-php/)

This was my first time using the PDO class, and my first time using React and Bootstrap as well.
